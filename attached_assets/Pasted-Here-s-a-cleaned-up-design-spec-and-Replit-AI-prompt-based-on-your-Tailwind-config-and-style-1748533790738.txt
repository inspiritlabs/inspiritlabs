Here's a **cleaned-up design spec** and Replit AI **prompt** based on your Tailwind config and style definitions:

---

### ✅ EXTRACTED DESIGN ELEMENTS FOR INSPIRT LABS

---

#### 🌌 Starry Background / Page Background

* Use class: `deep-space-bg`
* Defined as:

  ```css
  background: radial-gradient(circle at center, #0f172a, #020617);
  ```
* It gives a **deep, galactic, starry night effect**, perfect for an emotional, immersive product.

---

#### 🌫 Background Color

* Controlled by Tailwind `@apply bg-background text-foreground`
* Which resolves to:

  ```css
  --background: hsl(0, 0%, 3.9%); /* #0a0a0a nearly black */
  --foreground: hsl(0, 0%, 98%);  /* near white text */
  ```

Use:

```html
<body class="bg-background text-foreground"> ... </body>
```

---

#### 🚀 Premium Buttons

Use these button classes:

* `.primary-button`

  * Glowy gradient border, blur glass effect
  * Animates on hover (glow + swipe effect)
* `.secondary-button`

  * Clean dark-glass hover style

For **Send** or **Generate** buttons:

```html
<button class="primary-button">Send</button>
```

For subtle actions like “Cancel” or “Add Memory”:

```html
<button class="secondary-button">Add Memory</button>
```

---

#### 📋 Ethereal Login Page Spec

**Structure:**

* Centered card using `glass-card`
* Subtle glowing title using `.cosmic-glow`
* Login input styled with `bg-black/30 border border-white/10`
* No logos, just elegant text and a gentle CTA like `Enter` or `Begin Connection`

---

#### 💬 Chat + Upload + Trait Panel

Panel styling:

* Use `.panel` for spacing and layout
* Use `.glass-card` or `.premium-card` for UI sections
* Background: `deep-space-bg`

Components:

* Upload: drag & drop zone, classed with `border-white/20 bg-black/40`
* Trait sliders: styled range sliders with hover descriptions
* Chat: bubble layout, voice wave playback using `.audio-wave` bars
* Messages: animate `.audio-wave-bar` for active response
* Input field: `bg-black/50 border border-gray-700 text-white rounded p-2`

### 🧠 FULL REPLIT AI PROMPT

Paste this into Replit AI:

---

You are helping me build a premium full-stack webapp for **Inspirt Labs**.
Our goal is to let users **upload a voice clip**, write about a loved one’s **personality**, and **chat with a voice-generated replica**.

### 🎨 Frontend Design (Tailwind + React):

* **Starry Background**: Use `.deep-space-bg` with `radial-gradient(circle at center, #0f172a, #020617)`
* **Dark Theme**: Base colors use `--background: #0a0a0a`, `--foreground: #fafafa`
* **UI Panels**: Use `.glass-card` or `.premium-card` for every section (upload, chat, traits)
* **Buttons**: Use `.primary-button` for main actions and `.secondary-button` for extras. All buttons should animate and glow.
* **Send Button**: Must feel premium, click feedback, no lag
* **No dead buttons** — all buttons must be reactive, changing state or showing loaders

### 💬 Demo Panel Requirements:

* Audio Upload → Voice validated (10–60s), drag & drop
* Persona Description → `textarea`, live character count
* Trait Sliders → 6 traits (warmth, humor, etc.), dynamic
* Chat → full interface with bubbles, AI reply with ElevenLabs voice
* Playback → animated `.audio-wave-bar` while voice plays
* API code will be provided separately. You don’t need to handle backend API, just **build the complete UI + states**.

### 🔐 Login Page Spec:

* Extremely **ethereal and minimal**
* Centered card with `.glass-card`
* Background: `deep-space-bg`
* Only input: "Enter your name" or "Continue"
* Elegant `Begin` button using `.primary-button`
