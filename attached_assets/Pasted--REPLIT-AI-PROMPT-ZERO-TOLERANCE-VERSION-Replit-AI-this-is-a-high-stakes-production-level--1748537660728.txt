üö® REPLIT AI PROMPT ‚Äî ZERO TOLERANCE VERSION
üëã Replit AI ‚Äî this is a high-stakes, production-level implementation request for Inspirt Labs.
You must check every API call, validate every response, and fully wire the frontend and backend ‚Äî no mocks, no simulation.

üß† PURPOSE
We're building an ultra-premium product where users upload a voice, set traits, add memories + photos, and then chat with an AI replica that replies with real voice audio and visual photo presence.

üîê USE THESE REAL API KEYS:
js
Copy
Edit
const OPENAI_API_KEY = "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";
const ELEVEN_API_KEY = "sk_f72f4feb31e66e38d86804d2a56846744cbc89d8ecfa552d";
üîç MANDATORY FUNCTIONAL CHECKS
You must:

Validate ElevenLabs voice cloning API is working:

POST to https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices/add

Send FormData with file and name

Parse response: extract voice_id

Log this clearly to the console and show it in UI

Retry if .voice_id is missing or status is not 200

Use the actual voice_id in TTS requests:

POST to /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream

Must stream and play response audio from ElevenLabs

Validate it plays in <audio> tag or custom player

Log status, headers, and blob size

Send system prompt + user message to OpenAI chat:

POST to https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Include system prompt from form + tone traits

Include user message

Model: "gpt-4o-mini" or "gpt-4"

Parse and log the full JSON: choices[0].message.content

Retry on 429 or 500 errors

Log EVERYTHING clearly:

All API request bodies

All raw responses (JSON + headers)

All error stacks (print in console and UI log)

Add automatic retry mechanism (up to 3 times) if:

ElevenLabs returns malformed or null voice_id

OpenAI returns rate limit or timeout

üñºÔ∏è ADDITION: ‚ÄúPhotos‚Äù Tab
On the replica creation page, add a new section/tab: Photos

Allow user to upload up to 5 photos

Store them in memory array or backend

In the chat interface, these images:

Float in background

Randomly scale, rotate, fade in/out

Have subtle rainbow glow borders like Apple Intelligence

Must not block chat interaction

Animate continuously using @keyframes float, transform, z-index

üöÄ END GOAL
When I:

Upload a voice

Add traits and system prompt

Upload photos

Type a message

I should:

Get a real OpenAI reply

Hear it in the exact cloned voice

See the photo memory visuals behind the chat

Feel like I'm talking to someone real, with presence

This is a serious production request. Do not simulate. Do not fake.

‚úÖ I expect 100% working OpenAI + ElevenLabs pipeline
‚úÖ Logs shown in browser + console
‚úÖ Voice works live
‚úÖ Photos float in chat

Start now. Don't cut corners.
